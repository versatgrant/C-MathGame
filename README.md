This project was created using the C# programming language and in Visual Studio 2015.

The project specifications are as follows:

###A Mathematical Friend

A game based public system that puts any interested user up against the time to see how quickly they can solve random mathematical questions. The questions are to be generated randomly (for example: 8 / 2 – 1 or 2 * 3 + 9 – 3 * 6) and you are to determine the terms for the generation of the questions. Your system is to already have the answer to the correct calculations. Your system then shows the equation to the user and provide a way for them to answer. When the user clicks the “check” button your system will let them know if they are correct (by instantly going to the next random question) or if they are wrong (by stopping the game and presenting their score so far). The score must be a calculation based on the time the user has spent so far playing and how much they have gotten correct. That is: the persons who has gotten more correct in a shorter time must get higher scores than others.

###Issues

The game was built on a Windows 10 operating systems for which it runs correctly. When tested in a Windows 7 environment, it produces the erroneous error of quitting (instead of restarting) when a user enters an incorrect answer.
